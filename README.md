Designed and implemented an ML pipeline to identify genotype-phenotype associations in rice under environmental stress. Processed thousands of SNP features, corrected for population structure using a kinship matrix, and applied GWAS and QTL analysis to identify statistically significant loci linked to drought-related traits.
